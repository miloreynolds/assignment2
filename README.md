// Conclusion

In regards to RSVP speed reading, there are many factors that might affect a reader's comprehension of literature. Consider how RSVP differs from other ways of consuming text (audiobooks, physical books, e-books). With a book, one can take their time in processing the contents of each sentence. In RSVP, one must keep their eyes on the screen to ensure they don't miss a word that may be important to comprehension of the text or details within. People who are not accustomed to speed reading should be expected to score lower on comprehension tests that people who have experience with speed reading. Designing these tests, we did not have high expectations for the subjects of our study; we thought speed reading was probably less condusive to text comprehension than traditional reading. Looking at the results of our study, it appears that comprehension scores are pretty low (0, 2, 2, 3, 1). Still, it is hard to place whether or not speed reading is condusive to attaining a fair understanding of a text. Factors like wpm, question specifics, subject of the text, and number of words probably also have a great affect on comprehension of a text and corresponding score.
